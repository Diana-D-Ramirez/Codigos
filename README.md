# Predictive-Model-of-Methane-Yield

This code estimates the Methane Yield of a specific dataset from an Anaerobic Digestion model.
Use the DataSet file to test the practical applications of the function, where the data come from maize varieties.
The dataset contain five variables distributed in columns;
Lipids [%TS], Protein [%TS], Lignin [%TS], Total Solids [%FM] and Volatile Solids [%TS] in that order without header.
Experimental methane Yield values are in [L/g VS] in Target-Matrix file for its comparison.
